# README

The repository contains three files.

  * README.md, which is this file, describes the content of the repository
  * CodeBook.md, describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data and produce the tidy dataset.
  * run_analysis.R, contains the R script that produces the project result -- both of the clean (non-tidy) dataset and the tidy dataset.
